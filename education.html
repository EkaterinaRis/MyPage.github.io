        <p><span>Web Design</span><br><br>Web Design is an important part
        of front-end development. In the following paragraph I will share something that every beginner needs to understand.<br><br>
            HTML which stands for HyperText Mark-Up Language is used for creating content. CSS which stands for Cascading Style Sheet is used for styling purposes. Those two are quite easy to understand, so the real challenge is using JavaScript, Note.js, React and so on and so forth. Those are used for adding functionality.</p>

        <p><span>Programming</span><br><br>There is nothing like the feeling of joy that comes from coding. In first semester I studied Structured Programming. It is a programming paradigm where
        the problem is being resolved by dividing it into smaller problems. <br><br>In second semester we continued with Object-Oriented Programming, another programming paradigm where the problem is solved by using objects and by controlling
        their interaction. The four basic principles of object-oriented programming are inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.</p>

        <p><span>UML-Unified Modelling Language</span><br><br>In the picture next to this paragraph you can see an example of a class diagram. UML or Unified Modeling Language is a modeling language which is used for visualizing
        object-oriented systems. There are many different diagrams such as Activity diagrams, Class diagrams, Sequence diagrams, Use-case diagrams, Object diagrams, Component diagrams and Implementation diagrams.
        Each of them are used for representing the functional, static or dynamic part of the system.</p>
