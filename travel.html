        <p><span>Budapest - one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.</span><br><br>It was formed by joining the two old cities Buda and Pest which are separated by the Danube River. I have visited this
        city once before, however I want to go there again. On the picture you can see the Hungarian Parliament sparkling in its summer beauty</p>

        <p><span>Paris - the city of love.</span><br><br>I was 10 years old when I traveled to Paris for my birthday. But as you can see
        Paris is still on my bucket-list for travel destinations. This is mostly because I want to enjoy the long walks, French croissants and warm baguettes once again. Let's not forget the lovely
        pictures I want to take in front of the Eiffel Tower, Louver and Notre-Dame Cathedral.</p>

        <p><span>The unforgettable Spain.</span><br><br>I visited Spain once before, during an Erasmus project. We traveled to Murcia. During our one week stay in Aguilas,
        we had the opportunity to see Lorca, Cartagena and Alicante as well. Alicante is definitely my favourite. This journey was magical for me, I enjoyed every moment of it. This is the main reason
        I want to visit Barcelona and Madrid next. Hopefully Basilica de la Sagrada Familia will be finished by then.</p>
