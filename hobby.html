        <p><span>Sport</span><br><br>I am a very energetic person, so sport has always been my way of using that extra energy. When I was a little girl I was taking modern ballet classes.
        After that I went swimming. And when I was 12 years old, I trained volleyball for 4 years. I played basketball for only one year, but it became my favourite sport. Now I am
        going to the gym, but I still play basketball every time I get the chance.</p>

        <p><span>Rollerblading</span><br><br>In summer and spring my favourite activity is rollerblading. It is exciting and sometimes full of adrenalin. I regularly go rollerblading with my childhood friend.</p>

        After all they are the ones that give the best advices and recommendations for movies, series and books</p>
